# Introduction 
This is a tutorial on building and developing Agent/RAG and other techniques using Langchain / Langgraph 


# Setup 

To be able to run the code, you need to install the necessary libraries and set up the API key according to the following instructions: 


```
git clone https://github.com/trungviet17/simple-rag
