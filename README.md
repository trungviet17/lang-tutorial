# Introduction 
This repository was created for the purpose of noting and implementing RAG techniques through various courses and related papers. The code snippets are primarily used to illustrate the theory or to reimplement a paper related to RAG systems.


# Setup 

To be able to run the code, you need to install the necessary libraries and set up the API key according to the following instructions: 


```
git clone https://github.com/trungviet17/simple-rag
cd simple-rag
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Initialize the .env file and add the necessary API keys as follows:

```
HUGGING_FACE_API = 
GEMINI_API_KEY = 
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 = 
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT = 
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = 


```

# Content 

## RAG From Scratch 
This is my note from the Langchain RAG-from-scratch course. The course provides an overview of some basic and advanced techniques to improve the RAG process
